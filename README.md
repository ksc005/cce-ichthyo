### Additional Information on Data Sources and Management
**CalCOFI data**:
* Decadally averaged monthly means of upper 100m temperature and mesozooplankton displacement volume were derived from publicly available data on [calcofi.org](https://calcofi.org/) and can also be found in the data folder.
* Decadally averaged monthly means of ichthyoplankton species abundance were derived from a dataset provided by Andrew R. Thompson, Ed Weber, and Noelle Bowlin and can also be found in the data folder. Full and original ichthyoplankton data are also publicly available on [calcofi.org](https://calcofi.org/)

**Newport Hydrographic Line data**:
* 3y averaged monthly means of upper 100m temperature, northern and southern copepod biomass, and ichthyoplankton species abundance were derived from datasets provided by Toby D. Auth and Samantha Zeman and can also be found in the data folder. Please contact Toby D. Auth (toby.auth@noaa.gov) for further data clarifications and requests.
