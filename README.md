### Data Sources and Management
**CalCOFI data**:
* Decadally averaged monthly means of upper 100m temperature and mesozooplankton displacement volume were derived from publicly available data on [calcofi.org](https://calcofi.org/)
* Decadally averaged monthly means of ichthyoplankton species abundance were derived from a dataset provided by Andrew R. Thompson, Ed Weber, and Noelle Bowlin. Original ichthyoplankton data are also publicly available on [calcofi.org](https://calcofi.org/)

**Newport Hydrographic Line data**:
* 3y averaged monthly means of upper 100m temperature, northern and southern copepod biomass, and ichthyoplankton species abundance were derived from datasets provided by Toby D. Auth and Samantha Zeman. Please contact Toby D. Auth (toby.auth@noaa.gov) to request original data.
